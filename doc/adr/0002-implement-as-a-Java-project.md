# 2. Implement as a Java project

Date: 2023-06-21

## Status

Draft

## Context

The only current implementation is in TypeScript. We'd like to make the project more accessible to Java developers. We also want to illustrate the benefit of having the same specification for multiple implementations.

## Decision

To create a Java project consistent with the other Cucumber Java projects.

## Consequences

We would need to consult the maintainers of the Java projects to obtain a template and guidance to follow their conventions.
