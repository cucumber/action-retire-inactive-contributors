# 3. run npm in a container

Date: 2023-10-09

## Status

Draft

## Context

This is a typescript project and uses `npm` to run tests and execute the code. New contributors may not want to install npm just for this project.
Other contributors (myself) don't want to install and maintain npm on their development machine.

## Alternatives

Create a dockerfile to run NPM in a container with access to the source code.
Using a pipeline automation tool like Dagger to build and run the containers without depending on Dockerfile

## Decision


## Consequences

    - Both Alternatives require a working OCI container runtime (eg. Docker/Moby, podman, containerd, rancher, etc)
    - Using Dockerfile is a widely used convention *but* requires familiarity with the Dockerfile DSL
    - Using Dagger reduces the number of APIs *but* requires the Dagger SDK for Typescript
